Understanding Generics in Kotlin can be tough for beginners; trust me, I’ve been there. Let me tell you a little fantasy story to understand them easily.

After reading this, you will be able to :

Understand how covariant, contravariant, and invariant types work(with in, out keywords).
Understand that Kotlin erases type information at runtime and how reified keyword works.
Learn use-site variance, star-projections, and null safety in Generics.
Discover how Generics are applied in the real world(in Kotlin APIs).

In the land of Generics, three Android heroes — Warrior, Mage, and Archer — embarked on a quest to defeat the legendary Lord Ambiguous, who threatened the land of Generics.

They had to pass through the Forbidden Forest to reach the Lord Ambiguous, which taught them the variance rules in the land of Generics.
